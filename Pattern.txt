// Module pattern allows us to break up parts of our code info self contain modules with private variables and functions

// Singletone object is anonymous and it can only return one instence of an object at a time
// Repeated call will just return the same instance

// Factory pattern is a way of creating an interface for creating objects, 
// but we can let subclasses define which class to instantiate

// Observer pattern allowes us to subsribe and unsubscribe to certain events or certain functionality
