Autoboxing
    ArrayLists only hold Object, not primitive types. So if we pass int 2 to .add(2) method , it will be converted to Integer Object(2).
Random access data structures
    Each element is independent of the one before or after, meaning getting the certain element did not relay any of others contained in the data structure.
Sequential access data structures
    Sequential access data structure can only be accessed in the particular order, and each elemet depends on the others, and may only be getted through those other elements.
Starvation of callback/task queue 
    When the microtask creates another microtask and CB-in callback queue cant get his turn to be executed.
