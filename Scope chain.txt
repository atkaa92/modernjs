Scope is a current context of execution, simplly where the variable is accessable. 
Scope defines accessability of variables and functions in the code.It tells us what we can access and what not.
If JS engine canâ€™t find the local variable in the current EC it will look to nearest parent EC for that variable until engine reaches the GEC, 
and if variable is missing it will throw reference error of not defined. 

Lexical envirement means Local memory plus reference to Lexical envirement of the Lexical parent, which itself contains Local+Lexical, up to GEC.
Simplly it means where the code is phiscally writtrn. So where is function is written , not called.
Lexical parent means in which envirement function exists

So going throw this Lexical envirement known as Scope chain.
