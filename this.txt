this is the object that the function is a property of, or the object form which we are calling the function
Or this refers to whatever is the left of the dot. OBJECT.function
this gives option for methoeds to access to their objects and execute same code for multiple objects
this keyword is dynamically scoped. It doesn't matter where its written, matters how the function was called.
Arrow functions are lexically bind. They has lexical behavior. That means it will take object as this which is srounding it.

If we have function constructers executed using the new operator window objcet passing chain as `this` will be broken, as new operator creates its own context. 
So, if we are calling nested functions from global scope 'this' will be pointed to the first function 'this' which is 'window'. 
With constructor functions inner function will inherit whatever the parent function context is.
