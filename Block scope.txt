Block in JS is defined by curly braces {}, it used to combain multiple JS statements into one group.
The usage of this to give JS multiple statements wher it expects only one.
E.g. if(condition) {}
Initially IF expects one statemet, for example variable assignement, 
instead we can use block to execute multiple statements.
Block also known as Compound statement.

Variable declarations in block are hoisted in diferent scope named `Block`, for let and const.
Vars in block hoisted in `Global`.
There are `Global` for vars, and `Script` for let and const for variables in global space.
This is why we call let and const Block scoped.
Block scoped let and const are not accessable in Global scope.

Shadowing is like override variables in deiffernet scope. E.g.
let a = 1
{
    let a = 2
}

We cann't shadow Global let with Block var, it same as redecearing let in the same scope.
This is known as Inlegal shadowing.
There is no Inlegal shadowing for function scope.

Let will die at the end of the scope where it was decleared.
