let person = config.get('person') 
let street = person && person.address && person.address.street 
let street = person?.address?.street 

let street = person?.address?.street || true  
(If the value of street is false, state will consider between false and true and return true, which is not correct as street exists, it's just false) 
let street = person?.address?.street ?? true  

Now JS has 7 primitive types number, string, Boolean, undefined, null, symbol, BIGINT 
and one reference type - object
